# Airbnb-Price-Predicting
Kaggle competition on Airbnb New Listing Price Prediction (R)



## Overview
This project aim to analyze historical listing data from Airbnb and build a price prediction model for new listings. The inner-course project required us to compete with 464 students from Columbia University, at the end, my model ranked top 15% in terms of predicting accuracy (RMSE 59.08).
 

## The Kaggle Competition
### Description
People interested in renting an apartment or home, share information about themselves and their property on Airbnb. Those who end up renting the property share their experiences through reviews. The dataset contains information on 90 variables related to the property, host, and reviews for over 35,000 Airbnb rentals in New York.
### Goal
Construct a model using the dataset supplied and use it to predict the price of a set of Airbnb rentals included in scoringData.csv.
### Metric
Submissions will be evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error) (Wikipedia). Lower the RMSE, better the model.
